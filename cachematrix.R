a<-a## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly 
## (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). 
## Your assignment setis to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function (y){
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(inverse) m<<- inverse
  getInverse <- function() m
  
  list(set= set, get=get, setInverse= setInverse, getInverse = getInverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the 
## cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m<- x$getInverse()
  if (!is.null(m)){
    message("getting cache data")
    return(m)
  }
  
  data<- x$get()
  m <- solve(data)
  x$setInverse(m)
  m
}
